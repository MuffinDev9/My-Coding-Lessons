# My Coding Lessons
This Is A Github Page About The Coding Lessons I Teach My Class.  
I Teach Them The Python 3 Programming Language, And Some Fun Things To Make With It.  
## Lesson 1
These Are The Basics Of Python. First, Choose A Code Editor.  
For This Tutorial, We Will Be Using The JDoodle Python 3 Editor, As Linked Here:
