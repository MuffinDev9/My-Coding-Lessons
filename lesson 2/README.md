## Lesson 2  
In This Lesson, We Will Be Learning About Functions.  
We Will Be Doing Programming That Is A Tiny Bit More Complicated, So Get Ready.  
### Functions  
Functions Are Bits Of Code That Store Code Inside Them, They Can Be Activated Multiple Times,  
And Can Be Minimised To Tidy Up Your Code.  
An Example Of A Function Would Be Like This:  
```shell
# Creating The Function
def myfunction():
  print("I Am Inside A Function!")

# Calling The Function
myfunction()
```
### Function Parameters  
Parameters Are Variables, But Their Values Are Assigned When You Call A Function.  
These Parameters Are Created Inside The Brackets Of A Function:  
When You Are Creating A Function, You Can Put The Parameter Names In The Brackets, Seperated By Commas.  
And Then, When You Call The Function, Put The Values Inside Those Brackets.  
```shell
def MyFunction(MyParameter):
  print(MyParameter)
MyFunction("QWERTYUIOPASDFGHJKLZXCVBNM")
```
### Random Module  
The Random Module Lets You Randomize Things Inside You Code, Like Creating A Random Number Generator.  
I Will Teach You How To Make A Simple Random Number Generator, So Here Is An Example:  
```shell
import random
r = random.randint(1, 1000)
print(r)
```
### Homework  
This Time, I Want You To Make Some Code That Generates 2 Random Numbers, And Print Them On To The Screen.  
I Will Not Give You An Example This Time, So Good Luck!
